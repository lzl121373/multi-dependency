    "body": "Hello everyone!\r\n\r\nI have got a problem with using Google Guava in test project. I have configured a module with binding singletone implementation to an interface with wrong module configuration. Something like below described:\r\n>public interface Helper {\r\n> void a();\r\n>}\r\n\r\nand implementation:\r\n>public class HelperImpl implements Helper{\r\n>  public void a() { ...}\r\n>private HelperImpl () {}\r\n>private static Helper instance = new HelperImpl();\r\n>\r\n> public HelperImpl getInstance(){\r\n>       return instance;\r\n>      }\r\n>}\r\n\r\nand Module:\r\n> bind(Helper.class).to(HelperImpl.class);\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior:** Could not find a suitable constructor in Helper. Classes must have either one (and only one) constructor annotated with @Inject or a zero-argument constructor that is not private.\r\n\r\n**Actual behavior:** Application started on local JVM  is instantiated without error(_I cant understand why there is no error?_). Application started on remote JVM  is failed with expected error message(_correct behavior_)\r\n\r\nAre there ideas why it is so unpredictable? May be local JVM has another options?",

Use the default size for buffers instead, at a minimum.\n\nAlso change ConcatenatedByteSource.sizeIfKnown() to return absent if its Iterable of sources is not a Collection; this is to prevent sizeIfKnown() trying to loop over an infinite Iterable, which previous caused an infinite loop. That is also fixed in this CL; ConcatenatedByteSource.size() and sizeIfKnown() now stop and return Long.MAX_VALUE if the result would exceed that rather than going negative and continuing. But looping over an infinite Iterable in sizeIfKnown() seems potentially slow even if it will eventually stop, and as such against the spirit of sizeIfKnown(), which should be fast.\n\n27d33d4fd1bbbf6f5aacd8835633943da33300a3\n\n-------\n\n<p> Stop using ByteArrayOutputStream in ByteStreams.toByteArray methods.\n\nThey were using ByteStreams.copy to copy the source to the BAOS.

What about if the source list is small (<20) and k is 5. Currently I'm doing list.stream().collect(Comparators.least(5, ....)) but I'm wondering if this is more overhead to construct the stream than to either sort the array directly or if Ordering.leastOf would be faster. \r\nThanks!",

This is because the original call to subSequence() would generate a new String on the heap for each call, where as just using an offset avoids the need to generate a new String all together.\n\nThis memory enhancement was found while investigating flakiness issues for some tests which had the same root cause of: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded, mostly in the TrieParser class.\n\n100-test runs at original code:\nMemory usage\n- maximum: 503MiB (527,769,600 bytes)\n- average: 388MiB (407,225,077 bytes)\n\n100-test runs with my changes:\nMemory usage\n- maximum: 316MiB (325,271,552 bytes)\n- average: 221MiB (239,355,320 bytes)\n\nAt maximum: 187 MB saved\nAt average: 167 MB saved\n\nRELNOTES=Reduced heap memory usage when parsing domain names\n\n521c77000b665d5077524842cc0902583015043f",

It works by sending subscribers a few open issues in their inbox. If subscribers get busy, there is an algorithm that backs off issue load so they do not get overwhelmed\n\n[Read more about the CodeTriage project](https://www.codetriage.com/what).\n\n## Why am I getting this PR?\n\nYour project was picked by the human, @schneems. They selected it from the projects submitted to https://www.codetriage.com and hand edited the PR. How did your project get added to [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/what)? Roughly 9 months ago, [cupello](https://github.com/cupello) added this project to CodeTriage in order to start contributing. Since then, 156 people have subscribed to help this repo.\n\n## What does adding a badge accomplish?\n\nAdding a badge invites people to help contribute to your project. It also lets developers know that others are invested in the longterm success and maintainability of the project.\n\nYou can see an example of a CodeTriage badge on these popular OSS READMEs:\n\n- [![](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/rails/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/rails/rails) https://github.com/rails/rails\n- [![](https://www.codetriage.com/crystal-lang/crystal/badges/users.svg)](https://www.codetriage.com/crystal-lang/crystal) https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal\n\n## Have a question or comment?\n\nWhile I am a bot, this PR was manually reviewed and monitored by a human - @schneems. My job is writing commit messages and handling PR logistics.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can reply back to this PR and they will be answered by @schneems. If you do not want a badge right now, no worries, close the PR, you will not hear from me again.\n\nThanks for making your project Open Source! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.",

Not only does this behavior differ from what I am used to from other data structures like `map.keySet()`, but it also lacks any hint that it does so. My proposals are:\r\n\r\n - Don't make `nodes()` return an immutable Set, but instead a mutable set whose changes are reflected on the base graph.\r\n - Add some convenience methods for adding and removing multiple nodes\r\n - Add some documentation to warn that this does not behave as one might excpect\r\n\r\nSame might also apply to edges and other graph types in certain ways, but I haven't checked them out yet.",

    "body": "I understand the reasoning to move beyond JSR305. I do not think Checker-Framework to be a good replacement. First off JSR305 has [no dependencies](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/blob/master/dev-java/jsr305/jsr305-3.0.2-r10.ebuild#L17) required to build from source.\r\n\r\nThat is not the case with Checker-Framework, which seems to not be that easy to package. I am having to package\r\nchecker-checker\r\nchecker-dataflow\r\nchecker-framework\r\nchecker-javacutil\r\n\r\nWhich themselves have their own dependencies. Even worse Checker-Framework has not been updated for Java 9, and has issues there as you can see [here](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/blob/master/dev-java/checker-dataflow/checker-dataflow-9999.ebuild#L48) and [here](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/blob/master/dev-java/checker-javacutil/checker-javacutil-9999.ebuild#L48). I have fixed most via sed changes. But I have only packaged 2 of the needed pieces of Checker-Framework. I have to package more dependencies and fix more Java 9 issues for the remaining pieces.\r\n\r\nJust so I can bump [guava](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/commits/master/dev-java/guava) from 23.5 to 23.6. Checker-Framework IMHO was a VERY poor choice. It has to many dependencies. and does not build under Java 9. Which makes me think it is not a forward looking project. Java 10 will be out in a couple months....\r\n\r\nSadly I have come to expect such from Google.... Changes like this that go against logic reinforces that. Why replace a library that has no deps with one that has several deps, to a library project. Even worse a library that does not build under Java 9 nor has required changes in git for such. I haven't the time to submit PRs for everything. If Checker-Framework built under Java 9, then that would make a bit more sense. But then that still leaves adding more dependencies to a Library, which is not good IMHO. Libraries should have minimal deps. The [other dependencies](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/blob/master/dev-java/guava/guava-9999.ebuild#L25) of Guava do not have their own deps.\r\n\r\nThere are LOTS of choices for alternatives to JSR305. Google already uses Intellij. I would think [their NonNull stuff](https://github.com/Obsidian-StudiosInc/os-xtoo/blob/master/dev-java/intellij-platform-annotations/intellij-platform-annotations-9999.ebuild) to be a better option that has no deps. Like JSR305 had no deps.\r\n\r\nReally cannot believe the amount of work to replace JSR305 for a minor version release... This is the first time I am unable to zero day bump guava. In fact it is taking me some time and getting delayed by other things. As I have to allocate additional time in packaging Checker-Framework....\r\n\r\nPlease consider an alternative!!!!\r\n",

We have even taken dagger out of the picture and just tried to import Guava 23.3-jre itself as a compile dependency to no avail.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that this issue only happens with Guava 23.x+ and not 22.0 for example.  If we specify ```implementation 'com.google.guava:guava:22.0``` it IS added to the class path, but this ```implementation 'com.google.guava:guave:23.3-jre'``` is not.\r\n\r\nThis is our how our dagger dependencies are configured:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    implementation'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.14.1'\r\n\r\n    annotationProcessor'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.14.1'\r\n\r\n    annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-processor:2.14.1'\r\n    implementation'com.google.dagger:dagger-android-support:2.14.1'\r\n\r\n```\r\nI noticed some differences in the pom files between 22.0 and 23.3-jre notably that 23.3-jre uses the maven-jar-plugin where 22.0 does not.\r\n\r\nI know I am listing dagger configurations, but we have isolated the issue to the Guava dependency as we get the following error when building the project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nError:Bad service configuration file, or exception thrown while constructing Processor object: javax.annotation.processing.Processor: Provider dagger.internal.codegen.ComponentProcessor could not be instantiated: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/google/common/collect/SetMultimap\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis error tells me that SetMultimap which is part of com.google.common.collect which itself is part of Guava, is not on the Classpath/annotationProcessor path like it should be.\r\n\r\nWe feel that our ivy file might be missing something needed to get this all to work as this problem does not persist when using mavenCentral(), jcenter() and google();  We also noticed that using Android Studio Gradle plugin 2.3.3 that there are again no issues with compilation.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an issue when using 3.0.x+ in combination with our internal ant+ivy repo.\r\n\r\nAny help with this issue is much appreciated.  We have also filed a bug report with the Android Studio Gradle team here: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/71711793\r\n\r\nI could post the same in the Dagger repo but I felt that the issue presenting from a lack of Guava I'd post here before the Dagger repo.\r\n\r\nThanks.",

I understand, however, that there's actually an implementation for this already in the internal version of Guava. So I'm raising this issue firstly in the hope that it encourages the internal implementation to be open sourced, and secondly to see if any aspects of my own implementation could be used to improve the internal one.\r\n\r\n(For those who do not know what a topological sort is, it is a function that returns the nodes in a graph in an order where it's guaranteed that, by the time one visits any given node, one has already visited all of it's predecessors if it has any.)",

Since these methods are still in `@Beta`, can their signatures be updated to accept a `Comparator<? super T>`, just like `#least` and `#greatest`, as well as various methods defined in `java.util.Comparators`?\r\n\r\nRationale: as it stands my compiler complains when I write `emptiesFirst(naturalOrder())`:\r\n\r\n> The method `emptiesFirst(Comparator<T>)` in the type `Comparators` is not applicable for the arguments (`Comparator<Comparable<? super Comparable<? super T>>>`).\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to provide an explicit type parameter to either `emptiesFirst` or `naturalOrder`, but if the signatures are updated as suggested above that won't be necessary.",

The use case was similar every time: an incoming stream of messages needs to parsed and somewhat post-processed concurrently (and sometimes the process takes a lot longer than usual). The processed messages need to come out in the same order they came in.\r\n\r\nMaybe I missed something obvious with `ListenableFuture` or `Futures`, but I never found a utility from Guava that would help achieving such a task.\r\n\r\nI found Apache Camel's [`SubmitOrderedCompletionService`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.apache.camel/camel-core/2.20.1/org/apache/camel/util/concurrent/SubmitOrderedCompletionService.html) which does what I need, and as I said, it's not very hard to implement the service on my own. I simply think that such a often used utility might have a place in Guava? I'm _sure_ someone in Google needs this, so perhaps you guys already have one internally?",

This is a similar problem like overflows due to addition or multiplication, for which Guava provides various methods that throw exception on overflow (e.g, `IntMath.checkedAdd`) or saturate (e.g., `IntMath.saturatedAdd`).\r\n\r\nFor negation, Java itself provides `Math.negateExact`, which throws an exception on overflow, but there is nothing like `saturatedNegate`. Thus I propose to add `IntMath.saturatedNegate` and `LongMath.saturatedNegate` to Guava. These methods would return the respective `MAX_VALUE` if the input is the `MIN_VALUE` of int or long.\r\n\r\nWhile this is only a small utility, its value comes from the fact that having this methods would highlight the problem and motivate developers into always using these methods instead of assuming \"this won't happen here\". I guess that in most of the code, `saturatedNegate` could be a standard replacement for overflow-prone negations. I also intend to submit a suggestion for an error-prone bug pattern that flags such negations and suggests replacement with `Math.negateExact` or `saturatedNegate`.",

    "body": "According to p.1 \"API changes require discussion, use cases, etc. Code comes later.\", I'm going to start discussion about benefits of proposed changes. \r\n\r\nNow com.google.common.cache.CacheBuilder contains such methods as\r\n`refreshAfterWrite(long duration, TimeUnit unit)`\r\n`expireAfterWrite(long duration, TimeUnit unit)`\r\n`expireAfterAccess(long duration, TimeUnit unit)`\r\nParameters of methods listed below are used to define durations in time.\r\nHowever, in Java 8 new class,  [java.time.Duration](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Duration.html), was presented. It can be used to save info about time durations in exactly one object. That is easier and more transparent in some real-world scenarios. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to add overloaded methods:\r\n`refreshAfterWrite(Duration duration)\r\nexpireAfterWrite(Duration duration)\r\nexpireAfterAccess(Duration duration)`\r\n\r\nProposed changes provide possibilities to simplify code:\r\n`expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofHours(3))\r\n// instead of\r\nexpireAfterWrite(3, TimeUnit.HOURS)\r\n`\r\nIt makes easier to declare constant durations too:\r\n\r\n`public static final Duration EXPIRES_IN = Duration.ofHours(1);\r\n// some code after statement\r\nexpireAfterWrite(EXPIRES_IN)\r\n`\r\ninstead of\r\n`public static final long DURATION_LENGTH = 1;\r\n public static final TimeUnit DURATION_TIME_UNIT = TimeUnit.HOURS;\r\n // some code after statement\r\n expireAfterWrite(DURATION_LENGTH, DURATION_TIME_UNIT)\r\n`\r\n\r\nAlso, it allows to execute some arifmetic operations like addition or subtraction, that can simplify program logic if multiple (and dependant) durations in different methods and/or in different caches are used. Just something like this (simplified synthetic example):\r\n`\r\nDuration expiresAfterAccessIn = Duration.ofMinutes(30);\r\nCacheBuilder.newBuilder()\r\n                    .expireAfterAccess(expiresAfterAccessIn)\r\n                    .expireAfterWrite(expiresAfterAccessIn.plusHours(1))\r\n                    .build();\r\n`\r\n\r\nThis improvements do not lead to changing min java sdk version and do not break existing API.",

Hence, a single call to cleanUp() would  remove few items from cache, even though a lot more have expired. The limit on number of items that can be removed during a single call to cleanUp() [defined here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgoogle%2Fguava%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fguava%2Fsrc%2Fcom%2Fgoogle%2Fcommon%2Fcache%2FLocalCache.java%23L154&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGqv1QW_YjlrwtGXWDVUtQdPkTvZw) is non-configurable.  \r\n\r\nI believe this limit should be made configurable to allow developers the flexibility in configuring how the cache should be cleaned up.\r\n A potential use case for this would allow developers to use RemovalListener to perform business logic based on item removed and have a guarantee that all expired items would be removed from the cache by a single invocation of cleanUp(), whilst being fully aware that incase of large number of expired items there would be a possibility of a timeout.",

    "body": "I'm also observing some strange behaviour with guava caches under contention. According to @ben-manes, this is unrelated to #2863. Motivation for opening this issue: https://github.com/google/guava/issues/2863#issuecomment-338578756\r\n\r\nWhile I was doing some JMH benchmarks I noticed that benchmarks that were using guava caches stalled completely and/or had very erratic performance during thread contention. Benchmark iterations very often stalled for seconds, minutes or sometimes seemingly indefinitely. It turned out that the cache was the culprit in all cases.\r\n\r\nThe issue is _very_ easy to trigger. I published a sample project on https://github.com/hibox-systems/guava-cache-test that demonstrates the issue. In my environment it works fine with 1, 2 and 3 threads. Using 4 threads or more always stalls the benchmark at some point. I have tried the benchmark with all published guava versions that are compatible with the sample code, i.e. guava 11.0 and newer. Tested with these JVM versions on Ubuntu 16.04 with a Intel Core i7-3770 CPU:\r\n- OpenJDK 1.8.0_131-8u131-b11-2ubuntu1.16.04.3-b11\r\n- Oracle 1.8.0_151-b12\r\n- Oracle 9.0.1+11\r\n\r\nFWIW, I tried replacing the guava caches in the benchmarks with caffeine caches, and all kinds of stalling and erratic performance went away.",

It would be better off that it also has a method for the opposite direction: given a supplier, return it's value. Although we can easily get the value of a supplier by calling supplier.get(), it is feasible only when we already defined a supplier explicitly, we can not do it with a **Lambda** expression. For example:\r\n\r\n`String str = (() -> { return \"abc\" + \"def\"; }).get();` \r\n\r\nThe code above is invalid. We have to write this: \r\n```\r\nSupplier<String> supplier = () -> {return \"abc\" + \"def\"; }; \r\nString str = supplier.get();\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if Suppliers class can have a valueOf method, we can write this:\r\n\r\n`String str = valueOf(() -> {return \"abc\" + \"def\"; });`\r\n\r\nThat would be much more elegant. Of course, with a very short amount of inner code, it's not necessary to put code into lambda, but if there are many lines of code, putting it into a Lambda will give us better code separation of concern, hence easier to understand. Besides, providing such a method does no harm to the class.\r\n",

Performance issues in creating exceptions\r\n\r\nCounterargument:\r\n1. Looks programmers would appreciate it :) , see https://www.google.com/search?q=guava+preconditions+custom+exception& \r\n2. Newest Guava leverages Java 8, so now a lightweight implementation is possible:\r\n    ```java\r\n    public final class Preconditions {\r\n    (...)\r\n        public static void checkArgument(boolean expression, Supplier<? extends RuntimeException> exceptionSupplier) {\r\n            if (!expression) {\r\n                throw exceptionSupplier.get();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    (...)\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    and usage:\r\n    ```java\r\n    checkArgument(expression, () -> new MyCustomRuntimeException());\r\n    ```",
