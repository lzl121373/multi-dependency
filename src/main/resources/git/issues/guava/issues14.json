    "body": "Hey!\nI found that the following test will fail with a TimeoutException (the Future hangs indefinitely): \n\n``` java\n  static final int REPS = 10000;\n  @Test\n  public void hangs() throws InterruptedException, TimeoutException {\n    SettableFuture<Integer> settableFuture = SettableFuture.create();\n    ListenableFuture<Integer> chained = settableFuture;\n    for (int i = 0; i < REPS; ++i) {\n      chained = Futures.transform(chained, Functions.<Integer>identity());\n    }\n    settableFuture.set(0);\n\n    Futures.get(chained, 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS, TimeoutException.class);\n  }\n```\n\nBut if I change REPS to be something smaller, like 1000 (this will depend on the size of the stack) then the test passes. I think the root cause is is that the exception can't 'surface' to the final `chained` Future due to a StackOverflowError caused by repeated DirectExecutor.execute application.\n\nMy logging config may be screwed up, but I didn't see a log for this or anything, which made finding this a bit of a chore. I checked that this happens with Guava 18 and 19. Apologies if this is a KP or already filed (I tried searching Issues, but nothing related pops up).\n",

    "body": "The semantics of `or` on an `Optional` constructed using `Optional.fromNullable` surprised me. For the sake of example, consider this sample:\n\n``` java\n// Assume `possiblyAssignValue` returns type `String` which may per-execution randomly be\n// either `\"A\"` or `null`\nString maybeNotNull = possiblyAssignValue();\nString definitelyNull = null;\nString definitelyNotNull = \"C\";\n\nSystem.out.println(Optional.fromNullable(maybeNotNull).or(definitelyNull).or(definitelyNotNull);\n```\n\nI would _expect_ that the code would sometimes print out `A` and other times `C`, pursuant to the nullness of `maybeNotNull`; however, the `or` methods will always cause a runtime exception, because they check that the argument is not `null` (or doesn't evaluate to `null`).\n\nIn my case, I am using `Optional` to help parse a response from a server, which might contain one element or another, mutually-exclusively: if I try and use `or` to do this (which I think is reasonable), then the code throws a runtime exception anytime the first element is present. In this case, the contract with the server says that the second can (and should!) be missing.\n\nI'm not sure if it's the best solution, but one solution that presents itself to me is having a complementary set of methods on `Optional` for the two signatures which do not accept an `Optional` argument, such as `orNullable` which checks whether `defaultValue` or `supplier.get()` evaluate to `null` and return `Optional.absent` instead of throwing an exception. Such a solution would allow developers to both idiomatically code against their own assumptions about the mutual-exclusivity of two values' nullness, and explicitly handle edge cases (e.g. where the supplied default value is unexpectedly `null`) themselves.\n",

    "body": "At present, the Range abstraction is implemented in terms of Cut, but the Cut type (and the Range constructor that utilizes that type) is package-private.\n\nCut seems like a mathematically-sound concept -- something that's unlikely to change soon. And there are a number of Range construction use cases where the ability to define a new Range in terms of Cuts would be a useful public operation to support. One common use case has to do with Nullable (or Optional, as you will) bounds. It's often the case that APIs, particularly external APIs like RESTful interfaces, might provide either or none of the endpoints of a range, particularly as part of a filtering request from a client. It's difficult to use the existing bounds-based static factories on Range to construct an appropriate Range easily because they (understandably) don't accept null bounds. So there's typically a lot of branching code to call the correct static factory such as .all(), .atLeast(), .atMost(), or closed() depending on whether none, either, or both of the bounds have been specified by a client\n\nBut, if code that wanted to use Guava could use Cuts directly, it could express the range constraints it wants much more directly, such as:\n\n```\n// Assume lowBound and highBound are Optional<T extends Comparable<T>>\nfinal Cut<T> lowCut = lowBound.isPresent() ? Cut.<T>belowValue(lowBound.get()) : Cut.<T>belowAll();\nfinal Cut<T> highCut = highBound.isPresent() ? Cut.<T>aboveValue(highBound.get()) : Cut.<T>aboveAll();\nreturn new Range<T>(lowCut, highCut);\n```\n\nWithout the ability to express the range conditions a bit more abstractly, code like that above leads to a lot of branching code to determine the correct static factory to invoke on Range.\n\nIf Cut is not the abstraction to expose publicly, maybe there's some other compact solution to this (at least in my experience) common use case of Optional / Nullable bounds?\n",

    "body": "I regularly use `ImmutableMap.of(k,v)` to make up for the lack of a Map literal in Java as I find the syntax to be cleaner than initialising a map and putting stuff into it (and immutability is an added bonus). Since my use of this class is for brevity, I like to statically import the method as the immutability is not part of my intent. However the method name `of` does not read well as it does not indicate that I’m building a map. As a result I have been using a [wrapper class](https://gist.github.com/mrmanc/8a290b9cf4d59964e8e0) to achieve the same result:\n\n`assertThat(result).isEqualTo(mapOf(\"version\",\"61d85376\"));`\n\nEach time I can’t help wondering whether the community would embrace something like this in the original code, so I thought I’d raise an issue to discuss this :smile:\n\nAn alternative would be to use `ImmutableMap.builder().put(key, value).build()`, and that would be nice if `ImmutableMap.builder()` was `ImmutableMap.map()` but I prefer the one-less-hop method I’m using.\n\nOf course there might be a much nicer option that I’ve completely missed, and if that is the case I look forward to finding out!\n",

This is done using the following code:\n\n```\nFile file = ... ;\nString text = Gzip.unzip(Cipher.uncipher(Files.asByteSource(file), cipher)).asCharSource(UTF_8);\n```\n\nIt's rather straightforward. If I want to rewrite the file, it's easy, I just do the opposite :\n\n```\nGzip.zip(Cipher.cipher(Files.asByteSource(file), cipher)).asCharSource(UTF_8).write(modifiedText);\n```\n\nFirst, I have to keep the information about the file, the cipher and the encoding myself. It's not really good.\n\nSecond, not everything is that straightforward. Sometimes, decisions at runtime, based on the content itself (various formats, encoding). This happens directly in the `{Byte,Char}Source` and has to be preserved when writing into the `{Byte,Char}Sink`. Here comes the context.\n\nEach level of writing should have its own context, but that context should also be publicly accessible so that the information can be retrieved by the user when actually using the streams.\n\nA way I thought about implementing this is maybe to have chained streams containing their own context and which can return the final `{Byte,Char}Source` and its corresponding `{Byte,Char}Sink`.\n\nFor instance:\n\n| Level | ByteSource | Stream | ByteSink |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| File | FileByteSource | FileStream (holds path) | FileByteSink |\n| byte <-> char | ByteToCharSource | ToCharStream (holds charset) | ByteToCharSink |\n| gzip | GzipSource | GzipStream (holds zip level) | GzipSink |\n\nExample of usage:\n\n```\nCharStream stream = Gzip.wrap(Cipher.wrap(Files.asByteStream(file), cipher)).asCharStream(UTF_8);\nCharSource usableSource = stream.asSource();\nCharSink usableSink = stream.asSink();\n\nCharset charset = usableSource.getContext(ByteToCharContext.class).getCharset();\nFile file = usableSink.getContext(FileContext.class).getFile();\n```\n",

Additionally, having both `ByteSource.asCharSource` and `CharSource.asByteSource` would let us chain the two to transcode from a `ByteSource` in one charset to a `ByteSource` in another.\n",

However, now that we are past Java 7 end of life, it is time to at least consider doing that anyway.\n\nI'm proposing that I do some/most/all the work for this, but I wanted to run it by the Guava team before I began the process.\n",

    "body": "Hi,\n\nFluentIterable is very useful but lacks some shortcuts for transform/filtering of primitives and common data types (String, Date, Calendar).\n\nSuggestion for transform shortcuts:\n- asInt(), asLong(), asString(), asShort(), asByte(), asChar(), asDouble(), asFloat(), asDate(TimeZone), asDate(TimeZone, Format)\n\nSuggestion for filter shortcuts:\n- All: isNotNull(), isNull(),\n- String: isEmpty(), isNotEmpty()\n- Numbers: isNotZero(), isZero(), isPositive(), isNegative()\n- Dates: isToday(), isThisWeek(), isThisMonth(), isThisYear(), isWeekEnd(), isNotWeekEnd()\n\nThe shortcuts could be clever enough to do the conversion before filtering. E.g. If I use isEmpty() as filter then asString() is executed first\n\nIn case is too specific for FluentIterable a new Fluent class can be created.\n\nI can contribute with this change, but I prefer to talk about it first. I have some draft implementations.\n\nSome examples of combinations:\n- given a list of dates in numeric string format, get a filtered set of dates which are today\n\n``` java\nfrom(list).asLong().isPositive().asDate(TimeZone).isToday().toSet()\n```\n- given a list of text numbers, get a filtered list with the positive values as integer:\n\n``` java\nfrom(list).isNotNull().asInt().isPositive().toList()\n```\n",

With lambdas & method references this can yeild uses which aren't even too horrible, such as:\n\n```\nfor (MyTreeNode node : Iterables.forEnumerationSupplier(tree::preorderEnumeration)) {\n  //...\n}\n```\n\nand which also save a bit of memory churn c.f. `Collections.list`. \n\nIf you're reaching for the duplicate button already, the tickets you're looking for are: #1399 and #796 ;-)  Still I think the Supplier makes this well-defined, and hence different from the \"single-use iterator as an iterable\" graveyard-suggestion made within those tickets.\n",
