Additionally, the way I see it, part of the reason that HashingOutputStream exists is so that the user doesn't have to make such a copy. (That is, he could just write everything to a ByteArrayOutputStream, hash the whole thing, and then write the whole thing.) I guess that making a paranoid copy isn't quite that bad, since we're only ever copying a chunk of the data at once, rather than the whole thing. Still, I do think it's paranoia. The caller who chooses to use HashingOutputStream is almost certainly the caller who chooses the HashFunction, so any damage he does it to himself. We do like to protect against that sort of thing, of course, but I doubt there are even many custom HashFunction implementations in existence, so a bug seems unlikely.\"\n",

But its pattern to create new Collections after a stream chain is different than guava's:\n\nlist.stream().collect(Collectors.toList());\n\nThe collect-Method takes a Collector, a somewhat clunky yet powerful interface to build result collections both sequential (by adding single elements) and in parallel (by combining multiple elements via addAll).\n\nThis Method can also be used with guava-collections by defining its own collector based on ImmutableCollection.Builder, but there is one catch:\nThe Collector-Interface requires at least the following:\n- a Supplier: Builder::new\n- an Accumulator: Builder::add\n- a Combiner Builder::addAll\n- a finisher: Builder::build\n\nThe problem is the addAll-Method: In Order to be compatible with the Combiner, it needs to take a Builder as its ínput. However, the Builder.addAll methods currently only allows it to add Iterables, not another builder. So the accumulator-function would be something like builder.addAll(otherBuilder.build()), which is not very efficient, especially for Set-Builders.\n\n---\n\nThere are at least three different ways to solve this problem:\n- Make the Builder itself Iterable, so that it can be added to its own addAll-Method.\n- Add another addAll-Method overload to ImmutableCollection.Builder which accepts any ImmutableCollection.Builder.\n- Accept the overhead until guava is JDK8-ready, then roll your own Collector which can access the package-private internal structure of the builder.\n",

This is both undocumented and inconsistent. The questions are\n- Should non-ascii digits be accepted?\n- If so, should even mixed numbers like DEVANAGARI_DIGIT_ONE + \"\" + BENGALI_DIGIT_TWO be accepted?\n\nNote also that currently the fastest way to parse an Integer is via Longs.tryParse (this doesn't necessarily mean that accepting non-ASCII must cause a slowdown).\n\nhttps://microbenchmarks.appspot.com/runs/f32a811c-aeb5-40ac-ae48-07b60256838f\n",

We can change these existing users to using AsyncFunction which allows checked exceptions to be thrown.\n\nEarlier discussion:\n\n> Where is it specified that Function implementations should wrap checked exceptions in UTE? UTE is from java.lang.reflect package, so it's surprising to me to see us special-casing UTE in Future utility.\n> I think that this is the specification here :) Probably it applies only to this method and not to Function in general, and likely it was intended to be somewhere more... visible :)\n\nPeople do appear to be taking advantage of the feature, as demonstrated by a search for files containing both \"new UndeclaredThrowableException\" and \"com.google.common.util.concurrent.Futures.\"\n\nIt's an odd feature, though, and it might be wise to convert them to AsyncFunctions. Their computations won't necessarily be asynchronous, but AsyncFunction is allowed to throw any kind of exception, making UndeclaredThrowableException unnecessary.\n",

When I remove items from iterable by frequency and having them nearby, every found duplicate item is removed even the last one. At a bottom you can find test snippets. There is difference between use of ArrayList and LinkedList.\n\nNote: I know that I should use Set for this kind of situations, but imagine that you do not have String list but list full of legacy uneditable s*it classes. Problem is inside Iterables.removeIfFromRandomAccessList method.\n\n<code language=\"java\">\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@﻿Test\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void testOk() throws Exception {\n\n```\n    final List<String> list = Lists.newArrayList(\"a\", \"b\", \"a\");\n\n    System.out.println(list); // [a, b, a]\n    Iterables.removeIf(list, new Predicate<String>() {\n        @Override\n        public boolean apply(String input) {\n            return Iterables.frequency(list, input) >= 2;\n        }\n    });\n    System.out.println(list); // [b, a]\n\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testWrong() throws Exception {\n\n    final List<String> list = Lists.newArrayList(\"a\", \"a\", \"a\");\n\n    System.out.println(list); // [a, a, a]\n    Iterables.removeIf(list, new Predicate<String>() {\n        @Override\n        public boolean apply(String input) {\n            return Iterables.frequency(list, input) >= 2;\n        }\n    });\n    System.out.println(list); // [] should be [a]\n\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testOkWithLinkedList() throws Exception {\n\n    final List<String> list = Lists.newLinkedList();\n    list.add(\"a\");\n    list.add(\"a\");\n    list.add(\"a\");\n\n    System.out.println(list); // [a, a, a]\n    Iterables.removeIf(list, new Predicate<String>() {\n        @Override\n        public boolean apply(String input) {\n            return Iterables.frequency(list, input) >= 2;\n        }\n    });\n    System.out.println(list); // [a]\n\n}\n```\n\n</code>\n",

This becomes an issue when an iterator is used to generate and return extremely large object graphs which may consume sizable portions of available memory.\n\nWith the code as it currently stands, when computeNext() is called the reference to the previous element is strongly referenced and thus not garbage collectable until computeNext() returns. If computeNext requires large memory allocations, these may not be possible without allowing the previous reference to be garbage collected.\n\nThis should be a small change.\n\nCurrent code:\n\npublic final T next() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!hasNext()) {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new NoSuchElementException();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;state = State.NOT_READY;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;return next;\n}\n\nProposed code:\n\npublic final T next() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!hasNext()) {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new NoSuchElementException();\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n&nbsp;&nbsp;state = State.NOT_READY;\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;T tmp = next;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;next = null;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;return tmp;\n}\n",

It's of course not something I'd like the package tests to pick up. I can see two possible options for fixing this:\n1. Make the findClassesToTest() method exclude classes that live in the target/test-classes directory (or perhaps in some configurable directory for those who don't use Maven). This information would seem to be present in the ClassPath.ClassInfo, but not as far as I can tell in the Class<?>, so things would have to move around a bit.\n2. Make it easy for users to define classes that should be excluded from tests entirely. It is possible to work around this by creating an empty test class that has empty implementations of those tests that one doesn't want to run, but that's quite awkward and unintuitive.\n",

Using these static methods can be annoying, so we have FluentIterable.\n\nUtility classes also exist for Multimaps in a similar form, and can be similarly annoying to use. I would therefore like a similar fluent interface to Multimap operations. However, since the guava team controls the Multimap interface, I see no reason for a wrapper class and suggest the methods simply be added to Multimap.\n\nCompare:\n\nMultimap&lt;Integer,Double> iToDs;\nMultimap&lt;Integer,String> someIsToSs = Multimaps.transformValues(Multimaps.filterKeys(iToSs, Predicates.in(someSet), Functions.toStringFunction())\n\nvs.\n\nMultimap&lt;Integer,String> someIsToSs = iToDs\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.filterKeys(Predicates.in(someSet))\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.transformValues(Functions.toStringFunction())\n\nOne issue I see with this is the one that already exists with asMap and was addressed with the addition of static asMap methods; if you have a (Set|List|X)Multimap and do these transformations, the type system loses the knowledge of (Set|List|X)ness.\n",

For my use case, I add some registration for notifications that the cache entry is stale to a ConcurrentMap.  If an entry is stale, I do not necessarily need to reload it and so I only load entries on demand.\n\nI request a similar method invalidate(Object, Runnable) wherein I can remove this registration.  This will allow me to reclaim memory in the ConcurrentMap and do less processing.\n\nBetter yet, please add a flag to allow RemovalListener to be executed under the segment lock during removal.  This is ultimately more useful to me since I would like to cleanup the registration regardless of whether the entry was manually evicted or explicitly removed.\n",

It might be nice to have an Iterators.copy function.  For example, if I am writing an AbstractIterator that uses an iterator behind the scenes, and another function calls backingIterator.next(), then my abstract iterator is out-of-sync.\n\nThis function could be as simple as just calling ImmutableList.copyOf(iterator).iterator() - or it could be \"smarter\"\n",

The copy of FinalizableReferenceQueue in the JNR library fails to initialize over the Jenkins remote class loading layer. I have not tracked this down in a debugger yet, but I think I know what is happening based on code inspection (originally in the JNR copy, but the current Guava trunk sources show the same flaw).\n\nDecoupledLoader catches Exception, which would include ClassNotFoundException, in case the URLClassLoader it constructs according to some guesswork cannot in fact find Finalizer.class. If the ClassLoader which loaded FinalizableReferenceQueue and friends was somehow special—i.e. did not produce URLs from getResource which could automatically load related classes–then this load would fail, but that is OK since the CNFE would be caught and the next loader tried.\n\nThe problem seems to be that Finalizer also refers to a nested class ShutDown. If the original ClassLoader is unusual in any way (as the Jenkins remoting class loader certainly is, due to various optimizations), it could happen that the base URL is capable of loading Finalizer.class but not Finalizer$ShutDown.class. In that case a NoClassDefFoundError would be thrown, and as this is not caught, the whole initialization sequence would fail.\n\nI would recommend either\n1. Catching LinkageError, or at least NoClassDefFoundError, in addition to Exception.\n2. Removing the ShutDown nested class and just using e.g. java.lang.Error with a special detail message for the control flow you need.\n",

Also noted here seems that most of these have TODO's to consider making these public.\n\nFrom a previous issue discussion thread (Issue:480) it seems to be noted that this change would essentially require the addition of 1) Javadoc Comments, 2) Precondition Checks and 3) Unit tests.\n\nThe question posed here is has this issue been picked up yet since the ticket (480) seems to be from a year ago and the follow up here is whether it would be a good attempt for me to pick this up as a first contribution.\n\nClasses this would affect are:\n\nBooleans, Bytes, Chars, Doubles, Floats, Ints, Longs and Shorts along with their corresponding unit tests.\n\nHere a sample of what the proposed change might look like:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;/**\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\* Returns the index of the first appearance of the value {@﻿code target} in\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\* {@﻿code array}, in the index range of [{@﻿code start}, {@﻿code end}).\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\* @﻿param array an array of {@﻿code int} values, possibly empty\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\* @﻿param target a primitive {@﻿code int} value\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\* @﻿return the least index {@﻿code i} within the range \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\*     [start, end) for which {@﻿code array[i] == target}, or\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\*     {@﻿code -1} if no such index exists.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*/\n&nbsp;&nbsp;public static int indexOf(\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int[] array, int target, int start, int end) {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checkNotNull(array, \"array\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checkPositionIndexes(start, end, array.length);\n\n```\nfor (int i = start; i < end; i++) {\n  if (array[i] == target) {\n    return i;\n  }\n}\nreturn -1;\n```\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n\nUnit Test:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;public void testIndexOf_customIndexes() {\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(-1, Ints.indexOf(EMPTY, (int) 1, (int) 0, (int) 0));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(-1, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY1, (int) 2, (int) 0, (int) 1));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(-1, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY234, (int) 1, (int) 0, (int) 3));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(-1, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY234, (int) 2, (int) 1, (int) 3));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(-1, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY234, (int) 3, (int) 2, (int) 3));  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(0, Ints.indexOf(\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new int[] {(int) -1}, (int) -1, (int) 0, (int) 1));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(0, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY234, (int) 2, (int) 0, (int) 1));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(1, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY234, (int) 3, (int) 1, (int) 2));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(2, Ints.indexOf(ARRAY234, (int) 4, (int) 2, (int) 3));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(1, Ints.indexOf(\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;new int[] { (int) 2, (int) 3, (int) 2, (int) 3 },\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(int) 3, (int) 0, (int) 4));\n&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n\nThanks\n",

This happens for example when using declarative transaction handling (@﻿Transactional). \n\nA simple workaround is to have a separate listener object for the proxied class. \n\nI would find it most intuitive NOT to have (Async)EventBus synchronize anything and just handle any required synchronizations on my own, but adding @﻿Inherited is probably the simplest backwards compatible way to get async subscriptions on a proxied listener working. \n",

That is, the ResultSetFuture allows to get(...) with a timeout and also to add a listener which is called when the result is available. Internally this depends on AbstractFuture.addListener(...)\n\nI'm wondering whether the behaviour of AbstractFuture related to addListener(...) can be considered a race condition. I tend to think so: the documentation of ListenableFuture.addListener(...) indicates that 'The listener will run when the Future's computation is complete or, if the computation is already complete, immediately'.\n\nHowever, looking at the AbstractFuture implementation, I cannot identify code which would result in this behavior. If set(...) is called after addListener(...), the listeners are run. However, if the set(...) method is called before addListener(...), the added listener never gets run since it is only added to the executionList.\n\nI think I have witnessed this behavior in the aforementioned Cassandra CQL java driver. I hammer a Cassandra cluster with asynchronous queries until a maximum amount of queries is pending. The pending counter gets decremented when a listener to the ResultSetFuture (which extends AbstractFuture) is ran. However, many of them don't get run. Which can be explained given my 'race condition in AbstractFuture.addListener(...) hypothesis'.\n",

This avoids contention by amortizing the lock acquisition, rather than banging against it on every operation to update the policy state.\n\nA CLQ may suffer contention at the tail due to all threads spinning in a CAS loop to append their element. This is reduced by having one per segment, by default 4, though hot entries will hash to the same segment and accessing threads may contend. In ConcurrentLinkedHashMap this is reduced by having a global policy and best-effort simulating a CLQ per core, mapped by the thread id, and recombining in LRU order during the drain. Regardless, under simulated load CLQ does show up as a hotspot in a profiler.\n\nTwo proposals are provided. (A) provides closer semantics to the current behavior. (B) provides the fastest alternative (prefered).\n## Proposal (A)\n\nAn elimination stack is useful in any scenario where messages need to be transferred quickly and FIFO ordering is not required, by allowing operations to cancel out. This is ideal in an object pool and fits the requirements for Guava's usage of the recencyQueue.\n\nThe stack works by allowing operations to cancel out, which is linearizable. When contention is detected by a failed CAS on a treiber stack, a thread backs off to an arena, selects a location, and attempts to transfer the element to/from another thread. This reduces contention on the stack's top by spreading the CAS operations across isolated references. In benchmarking an object pool, I see significant performance gains under contention and similar single-threaded performance.\n\nGuava's cache only prefers fifo ordering, but does not require it. By not ensuring that constraint, the CLQ overhead could be reduced.\n\nAn implementation is provided at,\nhttps://github.com/ben-manes/multiway-pool/blob/8c55b8e03f84d97df964caf82cae456197762a7a/src/main/java/com/github/benmanes/multiway/EliminationStack.java\n## Proposal (B)\n\nIn CLHM the buffers record both read and writes for replaying against the internal policy, whereas in Guava's cache only recording of reads is maintained. As a cache is best-effort bounding based on semi-intelligent logic, it may be argued that the recencyQueue could be lossy.\n\nThis could be done by using a ring buffer (padded AtomicReference array), retaining an index cursor for the reader and writers, and use lazySet to null out consumed slots. A read could be lost or processed out-of-order, definitely so under load. This approach has a significant benefit of not creating garbage and minimizing contention. An implementation is trivial enough to not be provided, though easy to sketch out if desired.\n",

Apparently it was slow enough that it took up 13% of the total CPU time to handle the responses.\n\nhttps://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/pull/386#issuecomment-21350521\n\n(I mention in a comment there that I wasn't able to observe the performance impact.  That is because I was looking at HTTP requests per second and my testing environment was network-limited.)\n\nThat's a shame - I wanted to use MediaType specifically to avoid creating my own constants.  Can MediaType just be faster?  I want to have my cake and eat it very quickly.\n\nIn my use case, I render the same MediaType instances as strings many times, so memoizing the result gives the biggest boost.  Adding \".precomputed()\" to MediaType.TOKEN_MATCHER also gives a slight boost (for non-memoized results).\n",

I know that we can enumerate all objects in a Cache.  I know that we can also use Removal Listeners to receive notifications when entries are removed from the cache.  There is also the CacheStats.  However, the API currently doesn't provide for any method to determine when a given entry in the cache is due to expire (assuming nothing else happens to cause it to be renewed, etc.).\n\nWhat I'd like to do is provide a diagnostic / admin UI that shows all of the entries currently held in the cache - along with when they were created, and when they are due to expire.  I could probably store and maintain my own metadata for each entry to be able to determine these details myself - but it seems silly to need to duplicate data that is already being maintained internally by the Cache.\n\nAdditional, helpful notes from Ben Manes:\n\nExpiration is implemented as time ordered queues, where the head is the entry most likely to expire. The entries contain a timestamp which is used to evaluate for expiration. The traversal of the queues must be done under a lock and the cache lacks true global ordering due to using queues per hash table segments. For those reasons, exposing an ordered iteration is expensive and not currently provided.\n\nThat's the background for why this may not be added, but you can open an issue and maybe it will be addressed. It could be done by sorting without leveraging the queues, which is less elegant but perfectly fine for administration purposes.\n",

If this queue has a maximum size, after adding element the queue will automatically evict its greatest element (according to its comparator), which may be element itself.\n\nThe description of the add method in MinMaxPriorityQueue gives implementation details, but at the end of the day evicting the element which was just added is the same as rejecting it.  So I think it violates the Queue.add contract.\n\nConsider the following client code (and please ignore it's stupidity).\n\npublic static void add5(final Queue&lt;Integer> queue){\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try{\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;queue.add(5);\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println(\"Added 5 to the queue\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}catch(IllegalStateException e){\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System.err.println(\"Cannot add 5, queue full\");\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}\n}\n\nThe method add5(Queue) is agnostic to what kind of queue it gets.\n\nIf for example it is given a MinMaxPriorityQueue with maximumSize of 3 containing elements [1,2,3] the integer 5 will be immediately evicted.

I wrote my own solution which I summarized here:\n\nhttp://www.mydailyjava.blogspot.no/2013/07/extending-guava-caches-to-overflow-to.html\n\nI think, this would be a great addition to Guava caches because some expensive objects can be serialized and deserialized easily while only be constructed under quite some effort, for example if they require computation as in my use case. \n\nA native solution could fix the problem with the RemovalListener not being synchronized on a cache entry's key which I mentioned in my blog entry.\n\nOf course, I know that Ehcache offers this feature, but I often prefer Guava caches since they imply much less weight.\n\nI think this would really make a great feature!\n",

The call to `manager.stopAsync().awaitStopped(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);`&nbsp;in the shutdown hook never returns.\n\nI can make the example work if I swap the Executor given to manager.addListener from a `MoreExecutors.sameThreadExecutor()`&nbsp;to a `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()`&nbsp;(or other alternative)\n\nGiven the following code:\n\n```\nimport com.google.common.collect.ImmutableSet;\nimport com.google.common.util.concurrent.*;\n\nimport java.util.Set;\nimport java.util.concurrent.Executors;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException;\nimport java.util.logging.LogManager;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class DeadlockTest {\n\n    public static class ShutdownIgnoringLogManager extends LogManager {\n        @Override\n        public void reset() throws SecurityException {\n            // override reset() so logging handlers still work in shutdown hooks\n        }\n    }\n\n    static {\n        System.setProperty(\"java.util.logging.manager\", ShutdownIgnoringLogManager.class.getName());\n    }\n\n    static class TestService extends AbstractIdleService {\n        @Override\n        protected void startUp() throws Exception {\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"failed\");\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        protected void shutDown() {\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(DeadlockTest.class.getName());\n\n        Set<Service> services = ImmutableSet.<Service>of(new TestService());\n        final ServiceManager manager = new ServiceManager(services);\n        manager.addListener(new ServiceManager.Listener() {\n            public void stopped() {}\n            public void healthy() {\n                // Services have been initialized and are healthy, start accepting requests...\n            }\n            public void failure(Service service) {\n                // Something failed, at this point we could log it, notify a load balancer, or take\n                // some other action.

A more modular project structure would benefit those users in the following ways.\n\nCutting size of dependencies\nThe size of the guava maven repo is roughly 7-8MB with sources and docs. This is way out of proportion ,if I am only interested in Optionals and Preconditions. Most users won't comPlain about this nowadays though, as bandwith and storage are cheap ;) But why be wasteful, if it is easy to avoid. It is also useful if your list of dependencies conveys a little about your intent/stance on certain problem domains. If for example I could import guava-base only, one might guess that I do not appreciate misuse of \"null\", whereas if the whole guava is imported, it can be any number of reasons.\n\nStop polluting the Classpath\nEspecially in team projects it is important to keep the namespaces in the classpath \"clean\" to avoid confusion, misunderstandings and to make it easier for junior developers or new team members to adapt to your code base.\nBecause guava is a general purpose library, its naming is general, increasing the likelyhood for names to clash with private or third-party code. So if I introduce guava in our project to use its concurrent utilities, my collueges get bombarded with choices by the IDEs autocompletion regarding \"event\" and \"eventbus\". This is usually not a problem because \nA. the developer is experienced enough to know what he wants,  \nand\nB. such errors get caught by static type checking.\nBut sometimes neither A nor B holds true, confusing stuff happens, flow gets interuppted, kittens die, bad times.\n\nI am curious if people can think of pros/cons of a modular project architecture for guava itself. Faster iteration and update cycles for individual modules comes to mind. \n",

However, it isn't quite as useful when it comes to getting the first, last entries etc. \n\nCurrently, to get the first values, the code is:\nSortedSet&lt;Object> objs = map.get(map.keySet().first());\n\nTo get the last values:\nSortedSet&lt;Object> objs = map.get(map.keySet().last());\n\nIt would be very useful if this type of logic could be exposed as an API on the TreeMultimap class or even on the SortedMultimap API. This would simplify the above examples to be:\n\nSortedSet&lt;Object> first = map.first();\nSortedSet&lt;Object> last = map.last();\n\nThere could also be scope to extend this to provide equivalent functionality for other methods, such as headMap, tailMap etc. \n\nThese methods would be extremely useful, especially as the TreeMultiset is a sorted map; these methods are half the reason why I use a sorted map in the first place.\n",

I believe guava should log and otherwise ignore such cycles. \n\nI posted two corresponding comments in a code review that describes a fix, here: https://github.com/google/guava/blob/fab8b9744496a0ebca5232863ab186b7ac63c8e0/guava/src/com/google/common/reflect/ClassPath.java#L269\n\nThoughts?\n",

As Deque is part of the standard Java Collection Framework, I request to introduce a method com.google.common.collect.Queues.synchronizedDeque(Deque&lt;E>). Although there is no class like com.google.common.collect.Deques, the com.google.common.collect.Queues class already contains Deque-related methods like newArrayDeque(), so it would also be the logical place to put a method like synchronizedDeque().\n\nBeing kind of analogous to the synchronizedQueue() case, I already did an implementation for my own amusement, that I'd like to contribute.\n",
